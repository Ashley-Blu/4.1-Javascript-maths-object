# JavaScript Maths Object Mastery

## Part 1

1. Maths object in JavaScript > it is a built-in object that provides mathematical constants and fuctions, allowingus to perform mathematical tasks such as rounding, finiding max/min values, generating random numbers, etc

- No. You can not create an intance with the new Math() because it is static.

2. Math.round() > Rounds a decimal number to the nearest integer. 
   - e.g. 4.6 to 5 or 4.4 to 4

   - e.g. 4.8 to 4

3. Math.random() > generates random number between 0 and 1 with 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive - [0,1)
